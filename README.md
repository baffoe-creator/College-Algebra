# College-Algebra with Python

This repository contains several Python projects demonstrating different functionalities:

* **Financial Calculator and Utilities**: Provides functions for common financial calculations (annuity, mortgage, retirement, doubling time) and mathematical utilities (logarithm solver, scientific notation converter) with an interactive command-line application.
* **Data Graph Explorer**: A command-line tool for loading CSV data from URLs and generating basic plots (histograms, scatter plots, line graphs) saved as PNG files, suitable for headless environments.
* **Math Games**: A collection of interactive math games including a scatter plot coordinate identification game, an algebra equation solver, and a projectile motion simulation where users adjust parabola parameters to clear a wall.
